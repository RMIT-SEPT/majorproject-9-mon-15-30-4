The front-end design utilised additional packages to enable the creation of the overall system:
- react-boostrap
    install via "npm install react-bootstrap"
    * NOTE: bootstrap =/= react-bootstrap; react-bootstrap is a single API that combines bootstrap w/ react styles.
- react-shapes
    install via "npm install react-shapes"
